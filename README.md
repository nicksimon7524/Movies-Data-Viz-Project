# Movies-Data-Viz-Project

(**Note**: I consider this project "semi-guided" because parts of the analysis are my own, while other parts
were provided via the guided-project link referenced below.)

**Objective:** In this project, I analyze a dataset that contains information about movies released between 1980 and 2020.

In particular, I explore the following:

1) The relationship between budget and gross revenue
2) The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on gross revenue
3) The relationship between production company and gross revenue
